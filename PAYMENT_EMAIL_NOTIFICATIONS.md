## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Trigger
Emails are sent automatically when PesaPal IPN (Instant Payment Notification) confirms a successful payment:

```
Payment Flow:
1. Tenant completes payment on PesaPal
2. PesaPal sends IPN to backend
3. Backend verifies transaction status
4. If successful:
   - Update payment status to "completed"
   - Update unit/subscription records
   - Send confirmation emails (NEW!)
5. Tenant and landlord receive emails
```

### Email Templates

**Professional formatting with:**
- Clear subject lines
- Formatted payment details with borders
- Payment receipt numbers
- Direct links to dashboard
- Company branding

---

## 📂 Files Created/Modified

  - `handle_successful_subscription_payment()` - calls `send_subscription_payment_confirmation()`

### 3. **Updated**: `app/.env`

## 🔒 Email Configuration

### Current Setup (Gmail SMTP)
- **Service**: Gmail SMTP
- **Email**: nyumbanirentalmanagement@gmail.com
- **Security**: App Password (not regular password)
- **TLS**: Enabled (port 587)

### Gmail App Password Setup
If emails fail to send, you may need to regenerate the Gmail App Password:

1. Go to Google Account Settings
2. Security → 2-Step Verification
3. App Passwords
4. Generate new password for "Mail"
5. Update `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` in `.env`

### For Production
Consider using a dedicated email service:
- **SendGrid** (recommended) - 100 free emails/day
- **Amazon SES** - Pay per email
- **Mailgun** - 5,000 free emails/month

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emails Not Sending
**Check:**
1. `.env` has `EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend`
2. Gmail App Password is correct
3. Server logs for email errors
4. Email addresses are valid

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test email configuration
python manage.py shell

>>> from django.core.mail import send_mail
>>> send_mail('Test', 'Test message', 'nyumbanirentalmanagement@gmail.com', ['your@email.com'])
# Should return 1 if successful
```

### Issue: Emails Go to Spam
**Solutions:**
- Add SPF/DKIM records if using custom domain
- Use SendGrid or similar service for better deliverability
- Ask recipients to whitelist nyumbanirentalmanagement@gmail.com

### Issue: Emails Have Wrong Links
**Check:**
- `FRONTEND_URL` in `.env` is correct
- Update for production: `FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com`

---

## 📊 Email Logs

All email operations are logged:

```python
# Success logs
logger.info(f"Rent payment confirmation sent to tenant: {tenant.email}")
logger.info(f"Rent payment notification sent to landlord: {landlord.email}")

# Error logs
logger.error(f"Failed to send rent payment confirmation emails: {error}")
```

**View logs:**
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
tail -f logs/payments.log | grep "email"

# Search for email errors
grep "Failed to send" logs/payments.log
```

---

## 🎯 Email Content Customization

To customize email templates, edit `payments/email_notifications.py`:

### Change Email Subject
```python
# In send_rent_payment_confirmation()
tenant_subject = "Your Custom Subject - Makau Rentals"
```

### Add Your Logo
```python
message = f"""
<img src="https://yourdomain.com/logo.png" alt="Logo" />

Hello {tenant.full_name},
...
"""
```

### Change Email Signature
```python
message = f"""
...

Best regards,
Your Company Name
Phone: +254...
Email: support@yourdomain.com
"""
```

---

## 🔄 Payment Status Email (Optional Future Feature)

You could also add emails for:
- Payment pending (sent immediately after initiation)
- Payment failed (sent if payment fails)
- Payment refunded (if refund is processed)

**Example implementation:**
```python
# In email_notifications.py
def send_payment_pending_notification(payment):
    """Notify tenant payment is being processed"""
    pass

def send_payment_failed_notification(payment):
    """Notify tenant payment failed"""
    pass
```
