# Free Trial Subscription Fix - Property & Unit Creation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Free Trial Property/Unit Creation Limit
**Problem**: Users on free trial couldn't create properties beyond the 2-property limit or units beyond the 10-unit limit, even though they should be allowed to during trial period.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `check_subscription_limits()` to allow free trial users to exceed limits
- Users are informed that "Your subscription plan will change to [Tier X]" based on their usage
- Trial users can now add as many properties/units as they want during the trial
- System automatically calculates the appropriate tier they'll be charged when trial ends

### 2. ✅ Multiple Email Notifications
**Problem**: System sent multiple "limit reached" emails (sometimes 10+) when users tried adding units via bulk addition or multiple attempts.

**Solution**:
- Implemented email rate limiting using Django cache
- Each landlord can only receive one "limit reached" email per resource type (property/unit) per hour
- Prevents spam while still keeping users informed
- Cache key: `limit_email_sent:{landlord_id}:{limit_type}` expires after 3600 seconds (1 hour)

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **subscription_utils.py** ✅

**File**: `Makau Rentals/app/accounts/subscription_utils.py`

**Changes**:

##### a) Added cache import
```python
from django.core.cache import cache
```

##### b) Updated `check_subscription_limits()` function
```python
# For free trial, allow creation but notify about tier change
if subscription.plan == 'free':
    return {
        'can_create': True,
        'current_count': current_count,
        'limit': limit,
        'message': f'Creating this {limit_type[:-1]} will change your subscription tier.',
        'upgrade_needed': True,
        'suggested_plan': suggestion['suggested_plan'],
        'is_free_trial': True,
        'tier_change_warning': True
    }
```

**Impact**: Free trial users can now create beyond limits with a warning instead of being blocked.

##### c) Updated `send_limit_reached_email()` function with rate limiting
```python
def send_limit_reached_email(landlord, limit_type='property', current_plan=None, suggested_plan=None):
    # Check if we've recently sent a limit reached email to this landlord
    cache_key = f"limit_email_sent:{landlord.id}:{limit_type}"
    last_sent = cache.get(cache_key)
    
    if last_sent:
        logger.info(f"Skipping limit reached email - already sent within the last hour")
        return False
    
    # ... send email ...
    
    # Set cache to prevent duplicate emails for 1 hour
    cache.set(cache_key, True, 3600)  # 3600 seconds = 1 hour
```

**Impact**: Prevents duplicate emails regardless of how many times user tries to create resources.

#### 2. **views.py - CreatePropertyView** ✅

**File**: `Makau Rentals/app/accounts/views.py`

**Changes**:

##### a) Updated limit check logic
```python
# For free trial users at limit, allow creation with tier change warning
if limit_check.get('is_free_trial') and limit_check.get('tier_change_warning'):
    logger.info(f"Free trial user creating property beyond limit - will show tier change warning")
elif not limit_check['can_create']:
    # Send email notification (rate limited to once per hour)
    send_limit_reached_email(...)
    return Response({...}, status=403)
```

**Impact**: Free trial users proceed with creation; non-free users get blocked.

##### b) Enhanced trial warning message
```python
# Calculate total properties including this new one
total_properties = tracker.total_properties_after

# Check if this creation exceeds the free plan property limit
tier_changed = total_properties > 2

warning_message = f'Property created successfully! You are on a free trial with {days_remaining} days remaining.'
if tier_changed:
    warning_message = f'Property created! You now have {total_properties} properties. Your subscription plan will automatically adjust to {suggested_tier} (KES {suggested_price}/month) when your trial ends in {days_remaining} days.'

response_data['trial_warning'] = {
    'message': warning_message,
    'billing_info': {
        'total_properties': total_properties,
        'total_units': total_units,
        'suggested_tier': suggested_tier,
        'monthly_cost': suggested_price,
        'billing_starts': subscription.expiry_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'tier_changed': tier_changed  # NEW FLAG
    },
    'note': f'After your trial ends, you will be charged KES {suggested_price}/month...'
}
```

**Impact**: Users clearly see when tier changes and what they'll be charged.

#### 3. **views.py - CreateUnitView** ✅

**File**: `Makau Rentals/app/accounts/views.py`

**Same changes as CreatePropertyView**:
- Free trial check before blocking
- Rate-limited email sending
- Enhanced trial warning with tier change notification
- Includes both property count and unit count in warnings

## How It Works Now

### Free Trial Property Creation Flow

```
User on Free Trial (2 property limit)
    │
    ├─→ Creates Property #1
    │   ✅ Allowed (within limit)
    │   💬 "Property created! You are on a free trial..."
    │
    ├─→ Creates Property #2
    │   ✅ Allowed (at limit)
    │   💬 "Property created! You are on a free trial..."
    │
    ├─→ Creates Property #3 (NEW BEHAVIOR)
    │   ✅ Allowed (exceeds limit BUT on free trial)
    │   ⚠️  "Property created! You now have 3 properties. 
    │       Your subscription plan will automatically adjust to 
    │       Tier X (KES X/month) when your trial ends in X days."
    │
    └─→ Creates Property #4+
        ✅ Allowed (still on free trial)
        ⚠️  Tier change warning continues
```

### Free Trial Unit Creation Flow (Bulk Addition)

```
User on Free Trial (10 unit limit)
    │
    ├─→ Adds 8 units via bulk
    │   ✅ All created (within limit)
    │   💬 "Units created! You are on a free trial..."
    │
    ├─→ Adds 5 more units via bulk (NEW BEHAVIOR)
    │   ✅ All 5 created (exceeds limit BUT on free trial)
    │   ⚠️  "Units created! You now have 13 units. 
    │       Your subscription plan will automatically adjust to 
    │       Tier 2 (KES 2500/month) when your trial ends in X days."
    │
    └─→ Tries bulk addition again (same day)
        ✅ All created (still on free trial)
        ⚠️  Tier change warning
        📧 NO DUPLICATE EMAIL (rate limited)
```

### Email Rate Limiting Flow

```
First Attempt (Non-Free Trial hitting limit)
    │
    ├─→ Try to create property/unit beyond limit
    │   ❌ Blocked (403 error)
    │   📧 Email sent: "Subscription Limit Reached"
    │   🔒 Cache set: limit_email_sent:{landlord_id}:property → 1 hour
    │
    ├─→ Try again 10 minutes later
    │   ❌ Blocked (403 error)
    │   📧 NO EMAIL (cache hit - within 1 hour)
    │
    ├─→ Try again 2 hours later
    │   ❌ Blocked (403 error)
    │   📧 Email sent again (cache expired)
    │   🔒 Cache set again → 1 hour
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Free Trial - Multiple Property Creation

1. **Setup**: Create/login as landlord on free trial
2. **Create Property #1**: Should succeed
3. **Create Property #2**: Should succeed
4. **Create Property #3** (exceeds limit):
   - ✅ Should succeed
   - ✅ Check response for `trial_warning` with `tier_changed: true`
   - ✅ Message should mention tier adjustment
5. **Verify**: No emails should be sent for free trial users

**Expected Result**: ✅ All properties created, clear tier warnings shown

### Test Case 2: Free Trial - Bulk Unit Addition Beyond Limit

1. **Setup**: Landlord on free trial with property created
2. **Bulk add 8 units**: Should succeed (within 10-unit limit)
3. **Bulk add 5 more units** (total 13, exceeds limit):
   - ✅ All 5 should be created
   - ✅ Check each response for tier change warning
   - ✅ Message should show "13 units" and new tier
4. **Bulk add 3 more units again**:
   - ✅ All 3 should be created
   - ✅ Tier warning continues

**Expected Result**: ✅ All units created, tier warnings show updated count

### Test Case 3: Email Rate Limiting

1. **Setup**: Landlord on Starter plan (3 property limit) with 3 properties
2. **Try to create Property #4**:
   - ❌ Should fail with 403
   - 📧 Check email inbox - should receive 1 email
3. **Try again immediately**:
   - ❌ Should fail with 403
   - 📧 Check email inbox - should NOT receive another email
4. **Try 5 more times within 1 hour**:
   - ❌ All should fail
   - 📧 Should still have only 1 email total
5. **Wait 1+ hour, try again**:
   - ❌ Should fail
   - 📧 Should receive a NEW email (cache expired)

**Expected Result**: ✅ Only 2 emails total (1 initial, 1 after cache expiry)

### Test Case 4: Tier Calculation Accuracy

1. **Setup**: Free trial landlord with 0 properties, 0 units
2. **Create property with 5 units**: 
   - Expected tier: Tier 1 (1-10 Units) - KES 2000
3. **Add 8 more units** (total 13):
   - Expected tier: Tier 2 (11-20 Units) - KES 2500
4. **Add 40 more units** (total 53):
   - Expected tier: Tier 3 (21-50 Units) → Should jump to Tier 4? 
   - Actually: Tier 4 (51-100 Units) - KES 7500

**Expected Result**: ✅ Tier correctly calculated based on unit count
