Assist in transferring the current project's frontend from makau-rental-v4 to makau-rental-v4-improved which has the latest frontend styling and features but it lacks the backend integration so I want you to link this new frontend to my Django backend which is in makau-rentals and  update it in all sectors from login to signup to payment using mpesa ensure the integration is linked correctly and works as needed be and also ensure that the pages get the required data and display it well also ensure that the models match with each other to avoid conflicting issues that may occur and most importantly add error handling instances where necessary as implemented in the v4 old version of the project
