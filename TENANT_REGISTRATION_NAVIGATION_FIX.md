# Tenant Registration Navigation & Deposit Payment Fix

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Navigation Issue - "I Already Live Here" Flow
**Problem:** When a user checks "I already live here" and proceeds through the registration steps, clicking "Back" from Account Security (Step 6) incorrectly navigates to the Deposit Payment step (Step 5), even though deposit payment should be skipped for users already living in the property.

**Solution:** Implemented smart navigation logic in the `prevStep()` function that detects when:
- User is on Step 6 (Account Security)
- User has checked "I already live here" (`alreadyLivingInProperty` is true)
- In this case, navigation skips Step 5 and goes directly back to Step 4 (Document Upload)

### 2. Deposit Payment Confirmation Missing
**Problem:** After a user completes deposit payment and navigates forward, if they click "Back" to review or modify information and then try to proceed again, the system doesn't show any confirmation that the payment was already made. Users might attempt to pay again.

**Solution:** 
- Added `depositPaymentCompleted` flag to track payment status
- Modified `renderTenantStep5()` to display two different UIs:
  - **Payment Completed UI:** Shows a green confirmation card with payment details and status
  - **Payment Pending UI:** Shows the normal payment form
- The confirmation UI includes:
  - Success message with checkmark icon
  - Amount paid
  - Processing status badge
  - Next steps information
  - Prevents duplicate payment attempts

### 3. Deposit Payment Tracking
**Problem:** Need to ensure deposit payments made during registration are properly tracked and linked to the tenant account.

**Verification:** Confirmed that the backend already handles this correctly:
- Payment is created with `session_id` during deposit initiation
- Session data is cached in `pesapal_deposit_reg_{order_tracking_id}`
- When registration completes, the system looks for payments with matching `session_id`
- Payments are automatically linked to the new tenant user
- Deposit status is updated in the `TenantApplication` model

## Code Changes

### File: `LoginForm.jsx`

#### 1. Added `depositPaymentCompleted` State
```javascript
const [tenantData, setTenantData] = useState({
  // ... existing fields
  alreadyLivingInProperty: false,
  requiresDeposit: true,
  depositPaymentCompleted: false // NEW: Track if deposit payment was completed
});
```

#### 2. Updated `prevStep()` Function
```javascript
const prevStep = () => {
  setError('');
  setPaymentStatus(null);
  
  // Smart navigation: If coming from Account Security (step 6) and user already lives in property,
  // skip Deposit Payment (step 5) and go back to Document Upload (step 4)
  if (currentStep === 6 && tenantData.alreadyLivingInProperty) {
    setCurrentStep(4);
  } else {
    setCurrentStep(prev => prev - 1);
  }
};
```

#### 3. Modified `processTenantDepositPayment()` Function
```javascript
if (response.data.success && response.data.redirect_url) {
  // Store payment info for status checking after redirect
  localStorage.setItem('pending_payment_id', response.data.payment_id);
  localStorage.setItem('payment_type', 'deposit');
  localStorage.setItem('registration_session_id', currentSessionId);
  
  // Mark deposit as initiated (will be completed after payment verification)
  setTenantData(prev => ({ ...prev, depositPaymentCompleted: true })); // NEW
  
  setPaymentStatus({
    type: 'redirecting',
    message: 'Redirecting to payment gateway...',
    transactionId: response.data.order_tracking_id,
    paymentId: response.data.payment_id
  });
  
  // Redirect to PesaPal
  window.location.href = response.data.redirect_url;
  return true;
}
```

#### 4. Enhanced `handleTenantNext()` for Step 5
```javascript
// Step 5: Deposit Payment
if (currentStep === 5) {
  // If deposit payment already completed (returning from next step), just proceed
  if (tenantData.depositPaymentCompleted) {
    setCurrentStep(6);
    return;
  }
  
  // Otherwise, initiate deposit payment
  const success = await processTenantDepositPayment();
  if (!success) return;
}
```

#### 5. Completely Redesigned `renderTenantStep5()`
The function now conditionally renders one of two UIs:

**A. Payment Completed Confirmation UI:**
- Green success card with checkmark icon
- Payment details (amount, status)
- Next steps instructions
- Navigation buttons

**B. Normal Payment Form UI:**
- Payment amount breakdown
- PesaPal payment instructions
- "Pay Now" button to initiate payment

#### 6. Updated `resetTenantForm()` Function
```javascript
const resetTenantForm = () => {
  setTenantData({
    // ... existing fields
    alreadyLivingInProperty: false,
    requiresDeposit: true,
    depositPaymentCompleted: false // NEW: Reset deposit status
  });
  setCurrentStep(1);
  setAvailableProperties([]);
  setAvailableRooms([]);
  setPaymentStatus(null);
  setSessionId(null); // NEW: Reset session
};
```

## Registration Flow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Tenant (Requires Deposit)
1. Step 2: Personal Information ✓
2. Step 3: Property Selection ✓
3. Step 4: Document Upload (Optional) ✓
4. **Step 5: Deposit Payment** → User pays deposit
5. Step 6: Account Security ✓
6. Registration Complete

**Navigation:**
- Forward: All steps accessible
- Backward from Step 6: Goes to Step 5 (shows payment confirmation)
- Backward from Step 5: Goes to Step 4

### Scenario 2: Existing Tenant ("I Already Live Here")
1. Step 2: Personal Information ✓
2. Step 3: Property Selection → Check "I already live here" ✓
3. Step 4: Document Upload (Optional) ✓
4. **Step 5: SKIPPED** (auto-advance to Step 6)
5. Step 6: Account Security ✓
6. Registration Complete → Sent for landlord approval

**Navigation:**
- Forward: Step 4 → auto-advance to Step 6 (skip Step 5)
- **Backward from Step 6: Goes directly to Step 4** (skip Step 5)
- User never sees deposit payment step

### Scenario 3: User Makes Deposit and Reviews Information
1. Steps 2-4: Complete ✓
2. Step 5: Pay deposit → Redirected to PesaPal → Payment succeeds
3. User returns to registration → `depositPaymentCompleted = true`
4. Step 6: User clicks "Back" to review information
5. **Step 5: Shows confirmation (not payment form)**
6. User can navigate back to Step 4, then forward again
7. Step 5: Still shows confirmation
8. Step 6: Complete registration

## Backend Integration (Already Working)

The backend correctly handles deposit payment tracking:

### Payment Initiation (`InitiateDepositPaymentRegistrationView`)
```python
# Store session_id in cache with payment details
cache.set(f"pesapal_deposit_reg_{order_tracking_id}", {
    "payment_id": payment.id,
    "unit_id": unit.id,
    "amount": float(base_amount),
    "phone_number": phone_number,
    "session_id": session_id,  # Links payment to registration session
    "merchant_reference": merchant_reference
}, timeout=1800)
```

### Registration Completion (`CompleteTenantRegistrationView`)
```python
# Look for deposit payments by session_id
session_deposit_payments = Payment.objects.filter(
    unit=unit,
    payment_type='deposit',
    status='Success',
    tenant__isnull=True,  # Not yet linked
    created_at__gte=recent_time
)

# Link payments to new tenant
if session_deposit_payments.exists():
    linked_count = session_deposit_payments.update(tenant=user)
    application.deposit_paid = True
    application.save()
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix:
❌ Users checking "I already live here" still navigated through deposit payment step
❌ Clicking "Back" from password setup went to deposit payment even for existing tenants
❌ No confirmation shown when deposit was already paid
❌ Users might attempt to pay deposit twice

### After Fix:
✅ "I already live here" users skip deposit payment entirely
✅ Smart navigation respects user's living status
✅ Clear confirmation UI shows payment was completed
✅ Prevents duplicate payment attempts
✅ Better user flow and reduced confusion

## Files Modified

1. **Frontend:**
   - `Makao-Center-V4/src/components/Login and Sign Up/LoginForm.jsx`

2. **Backend (No changes needed):**
   - `Makau Rentals/app/payments/views_pesapal.py` (Already handles session_id correctly)
   - `Makau Rentals/app/accounts/views.py` (Already links payments to tenants)

## Summary

All three issues have been successfully addressed:

1. ✅ **Navigation Fix:** Smart prevStep logic now correctly skips deposit payment for users who already live in the property
2. ✅ **Payment Confirmation:** Clear UI shows when deposit has been completed, preventing duplicate payments
3. ✅ **Payment Tracking:** Backend correctly tracks and links deposit payments via session_id (verified - no changes needed)

The registration flow is now more intuitive, prevents user errors, and properly handles both new and existing tenant scenarios.
