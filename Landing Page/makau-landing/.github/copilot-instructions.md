```

## Next Steps

1. **Replace placeholder content:**
   - Update contact email and phone in Footer and Contact page
   - Add actual pricing in PricingCard
   - Replace `https://example.com` with your production URL in metadata

2. **Add images:**
   - Add logo to `public/`
   - Add Open Graph image as `public/og-image.png` (1200x630px)
   - Add PWA icons as `public/icon-192.png` and `public/icon-512.png`

3. **Set up contact form backend:**
   - Integrate with Formspree, Netlify Forms, or custom API
   - Update form submission logic in `src/app/contact/page.tsx`

4. **Deploy:**
   - Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your hosting provider
   - Configure environment variables if needed
   - Update `metadataBase` URL after deployment

5. **Integrate with existing React app:**
   - See README for integration options (link, iframe, reverse proxy, or migration)

## Known Issues

- CSS linter shows warnings for `@tailwind` directives (Tailwind v4 uses `@import` but we use `@tailwind` for compatibility). These are cosmetic and don't affect functionality.
- Multiple lockfile warning can be silenced by setting `turbopack.root` in `next.config.ts` if needed.
